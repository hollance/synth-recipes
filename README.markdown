I've been collecting code snippets of sound synthesis algorithms for a while now. Recently I decided to clean up my notes and organize them a bit better into a handy reference.

The inspiration for this is *The Pocket Handbook of Image Processing Algorithms In C* by Myler & Weeks, a concise guide of algorithms for image processing. I was looking for something similar for audio synthesis but came up empty-handed, so I've started to write my own.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive treatise of the entire field of digital audio synthesis, only a quick  reference â€” with working source code! Where possible I have included links to material for further research.

The goal of this work is to educate, not necessarily to provide a DSP library that has super optimized ready-to-use routines. Feel free to take this code and tweak it to your needs.

## Table of contents

Introduction:

- Quick introduction to digital audio
- How to read this guide
- How to run the source code

Basic waveforms:

- Sine waves

Noise:

- [White noise / random numbers](recipes/white-noise.markdown)
- [LFSR noise](recipes/lfsr-noise.markdown)
- [Filtered noise & explosions](recipes/explosions.markdown)
- Pink noise

ðŸ‘· This is a work in progress! I'll be adding new content every so often.

## Is this enough to build a synthesizer?

Yes and no. The purpose of this guide is purely to describe different algorithms for producing sound. That is an important part of building a musical instrument, but not the only part. To implement a complete software synthesizer, you will need to tackle a lot of additional functionality such as:

- handling MIDI
- using envelopes to shape the sound over time
- polyphony and voice support
- filters
- modulation
- user-configurable parameters
- talking to a host through the VST or Audio Unit protocol
- a user interface
- and many other features...

Those topics are outside the scope of this guide. As it happens, I also wrote a book about how to do all this other stuff: [Code Your Own Synth Plug-Ins With C++ and JUCE](https://leanpub.com/synth-plugin).

![Cover of my synth book](illustrations/book-cover.jpg)

Learn the fundamentals of audio programming by building a fully-featured software synthesizer plug-in, with every step explained along the way. The plug-in can be used in all the popular DAWs and is made using the industry standard tools for audio development: JUCE framework and the C++ programming language. Not too much math, lots of explanations!
